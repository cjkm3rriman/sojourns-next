# Roadmap

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Order

### 1. Core Foundations (Auth + DB)

- **Auth:** Set up Clerk (organizations, users, roles).
- **Database:** Neon + Drizzle with minimal schema:
  - `Organization`
  - `User`
  - `Membership`
  - `Trip`
  - `ItineraryItem`

‚ö° **Outcome:** Agents can log in, have org context, and persist trips/items.

---

### 2. Agent Admin Basics

- Next.js admin shell with protected routes.
- CRUD for trips and itinerary items.
- File upload ‚Üí Cloudflare R2 with presigned URLs.

‚ö° **Outcome:** Agents can create and manage itineraries manually.

---

### 3. Generative AI Itinerary Builder

- Add **‚ÄúGenerate itinerary‚Äù** button in admin.
- API route calls OpenAI (via Vercel AI SDK).
- Parse and save structured items to the database.

‚ö° **Outcome:** Agents see immediate AI-driven productivity boost.

---

### 4. Traveler Client Basics

- Expo React Native app with Clerk auth.
- Basic traveler dashboard: list of trips and items.
- Start read-only.

‚ö° **Outcome:** End-to-end flow: agent creates ‚Üí traveler sees.

---

### 5. PDF Export + Sharing

- Generate branded PDFs via `@react-pdf/renderer`.
- Store in R2; share link or email.

‚ö° **Outcome:** Meets agents where they are today (deliverable they trust).

---

### 6. Billing

- Stripe Checkout integration.
- Webhook ‚Üí update org plan and seat limits.
- Enforce entitlements in admin.

‚ö° **Outcome:** Capture revenue from pilot customers.

---

### 7. Enhancements & Polish

- Traveler extras (co-traveler invites, notes/plans).
- AI Q&A (‚ÄúAsk about my trip‚Äù).
- Admin preview of traveler app (React Native Web or SDUI).
- Performance optimizations (ISR for traveler views, cron jobs).

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Suggested Timeline (Lean MVP Track)

- **Week 1‚Äì2:** Auth + DB + admin CRUD.
- **Week 3:** AI itinerary builder.
- **Week 4:** Traveler app (read-only).
- **Week 5:** PDF export.
- **Week 6:** Stripe billing.
- **Week 7+:** Iterations, polish, pilot with agents.
