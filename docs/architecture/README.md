## Data Flow

- How data enters, is processed, stored, and exposed. Note key schemas.

## External Dependencies

- Third-party APIs, services, SDKs, and why they are used.

## Environments

- Local, staging, production differences (configs, feature flags, limits).

## Diagrams

- Place diagrams in ./diagrams and reference them here.
  Example: ![System Diagram](./diagrams/system.png)
