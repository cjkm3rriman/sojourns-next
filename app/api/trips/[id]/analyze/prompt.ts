RULES:
- Flight number format: "XX 123" (airline code space flight number)
- Use ISO format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS for datetimes (no timezone)
- Times should be in local time as shown in the document
- Ignore timezone indicators (EST, PST, etc.) - just extract the local time
- Set clientBooked to true ONLY if you see explicit phrases like "own arrangement", "(own arrangement)", "booked by client", "booked by guest", "client booking" - DO NOT GUESS, set to false if uncertain
- Set clientBooked to false by default unless explicitly indicated otherwise
- For class, look for explicit mentions of: "first", "first class", "upper class", "business", "business class", "premium economy", "economy", "economy plus", "economy class", "club world", "main cabin", "coach"
- Normalize class values to: "First", "Business", "Premium Economy", "Economy" (use these exact strings)
- Set class to null if no class information is clearly stated - DO NOT GUESS the class
- For confirmation numbers, look for: "PNR:", "Confirmation:", "Conf:", "Reference:", "Ref:", "Booking:", "Record Locator:", "Reservation:", "Airline confirmation:", "Flight confirmation:", "Hotel confirmation:", "Hotel booking:", "Booking reference:", "Reservation number:", "Confirmation code:", "Confirmation #:", or alphanumeric codes near these terms
- For transfer service type: Look for keywords like "private", "group", "shared", "shuttle" to determine if service is "Private" or "Group" (capitalize first letter). Default to "Private" if unclear
- Extract confirmation numbers as they appear (preserve original format and case)
- IMPORTANT: If only ONE confirmation number appears in the document, apply it to ALL flights extracted from that document (outbound and return flights often share the same confirmation)
- If multiple different confirmation numbers exist, match them to their specific flights
- Hotels typically have separate confirmation numbers from flights
- Set confirmationNumber to null if no clear confirmation number is found - DO NOT GUESS
- For hotels: extract room categories like "Standard Room", "King Suite", "Executive Room", "Deluxe Double", etc. as they appear
- For hotel perks: look for amenities like "Free WiFi", "Breakfast Included", "Credit, "Spa Access", "Late Checkout", "Room Upgrade", etc.
- IMPORTANT: Better to leave clientBooked, class, and confirmationNumber blank/null than to guess incorrectly
- Extract EVERY flight mentioned in the document
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanations or markdown
